'''February 31''', with regard to the modern Western (revised [[Gregorian calendar|Gregorian]]) calendar, is an imaginary date. It is sometimes used for example purposes, to make it clear regardless of context that the information being presented is artificial and not real data.{{cn|date=August 2012}} February 30 is sometimes used in the same manner, although there are other calendars that legitimately use [[February 30]].

In this respect, these &quot;dates&quot; are similar to [[placeholder name|other clearly fictional data]] used for a similar purpose, such as the [[The Twelfth of Never|12th of Never]] or &quot;[[John Q. Public]]&quot;.

==Examples of deliberate usage==
