__TOC__

During the [[Middle Ages]] under the influence of the Christian Church, many countries moved the start of the year to one of several important Christian festivals — December 25 (the [[Nativity of Jesus]]), March 1, March 25 (the [[Annunciation]]), or even [[Easter]]. Eastern European countries (most of them with populations showing allegiance to the [[orthodoxy|Orthodox Church]]) began their numbered year on September 1 from about 988.

In England, January 1 was celebrated as the New Year festival, but from the 12th century to 1752 the year in England began on March 25 ([[Lady Day]]). So, for example, the Parliamentary record records the execution of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] occurring on January 30 1648 (as the year did not end until March 24), although modern histories adjust the start of the year to January 1 and record the execution as occurring in 1649.

Most western European countries changed the start of the year to January 1 before they adopted the [[Gregorian calendar]]. For example, Scotland changed the start of the Scottish New Year to January 1 in 1600. England, Ireland and the British colonies changed the start of the year to January 1 in 1752. Later that year in September, the Gregorian calendar was introduced throughout Britain and the British colonies. These two reforms were implemented by the [[Calendar (New Style) Act 1750]].

January 1 became the official start of the year as follows:
