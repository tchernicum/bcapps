# Tests to confirm my domains are working properly

# I dub my testing system "nag yer ass"<h>, since it nags yer ass
# constantly, much like that other snake-oil monitoring system with a
# similar name</h>

# TODO: I'm almost 100% convinced this is the wrong way to do things;
# ie, using complex single line pipes instead of short scripts or
# something

# NOTES: (why don't I use nagios, hmmm?) [enamored w/ parallel?]
#   - "paste -s -d," pastes multiple lines into a single line
#   - "sort" insures lines are in canonical order
#   - hardcoding IP address in multiple places is REALLY ugly
#   - ability to loop tests across hosts would be nice
#   - test dependency would be nice
#   - ability to run only specific tests would be nice
