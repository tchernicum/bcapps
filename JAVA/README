Notes:

  - To run, cd to directory where this is installed and "java -cp . Starmap"

  - After running the program, click the mouse at least once on the
  canvas, otherwise nothing else will work (not sure why)

  - Use cursor keys to pan, page up/down to rotate, F7/F8 to zoom in/out

  - Click on/near star to identify; click again to remove identification

  - I originally wrote this WAYYYYYY back in 1995 (I think), so it's
  poorly written, not compliant with current Java (generates warnings
  when compiling), etc. Also, I was a poorer coder then (hard to
  believe), so the code isn't as well written or as well documented as
  my current code.

  - Uploaded to github primarily for a friend, not really useful nowadays.
