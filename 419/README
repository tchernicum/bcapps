Tools to help bait scammers, in particular advance fee scammers.

The idea is to actually shut them down by overwhelming them with fake emails.

<h>I am probably enjoying this far too much</h>

First ping: leonard.zepowitz@dudmail.com, as below:

ping-419.pl --from="leonard.zepowitz@dudmail.com" --to=list1.txt --subject="The email you have sent me" msgfile.txt --debug

STRATEGY AND FILES
==================

[this strategy is not yet in place]

Ping strategy: [run bc-ping.pl to do this]

  - Frequently, obtain list of *possible* scammers (and possible
  innocent people) by scraping scamreporter sites and/or manually to
  create file toping.txt

  - Autoremove people in pinged.txt from toping.txt

  - Ping people with from address: leonard.zeptowitz+{n}@gmail.com,
  where n is a unique number

  - Remove addresses from toping.txt and add to pinged.txt along with
  the pinging address

Reply strategy:

  - leonard.zeptowitz@gmail.com has spam filtering turned off

  - Setup gmail autoreply with my "contact info", hoping scammer will
  spend time customizing fake form for me and/or otherwise respond.

  - Check to make sure scammer has replied to correct {n} address; if
  scammer is now using a different From/Reply-to: address, ping that
  one as well.

  - From that sublist, manually vette who is an actual scammer, since
  innocent people may reply in confusion too. Add the true scammers to
  confirmed.txt

"Flood" strategy: (bc-hit-scammer.pl will do this)

  - Send confirmed.txt many emails designed to waste time: random
  address information, long surveys, instruction requests, and so on.

  - The emails will come from non-existent, but realistic looking,
  email addresses, so the replies will bounce. Alternately, the emails
  come from addresses of other verified scammers.

  - Scammers send out bulk emails: we're trying to make them think
  they hit an unusually good list of addresses.

  - The goal is NOT to flood/close their mailboxes, but to force them
  to send replies, since they can never be sure which request is "legit"
  and which isn't.

Chat strategy: (bc-check-scammer.pl will confirm these are all on my buddy list [not yet written])

  - For confirmed scammers with gmail.com, aim.com, and similar
  addresses, add to buddy list and annoy as possible.
