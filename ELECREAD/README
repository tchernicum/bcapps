An attempt to autoread my electric meter (I take snapshots every
minute). Notes:

  - This is a sample of 100 snapshots; many more exist

  - The camera is fixed

  - Many readings are dark, illegible, staticky, etc. It's important
  that these be discarded (ie, misreading is worse than no reading).

  - long-term, the program will know of previous readings (which might
  help it improve accuracy)
