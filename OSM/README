Adding many data to openstreetmap.org

Here's what I did with the output of bc-biz2ll.pl (ie,
data/businessaddresses.txt):

bzcat ../db/abqaddr.bz2|perl -pnle 's/\|/ /isg;' > /var/tmp/addr-with-space.txt
fgrep --color=always -if data/businessaddresses.txt /var/tmp/addr-with-space.txt > data/bizll.txt

This gives me latitude/longitude for ABQ businesses (roughly). Adding
coloring will let me snip out the exact address from the line.
