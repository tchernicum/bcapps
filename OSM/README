Adding many data to openstreetmap.org

This projects aims to add all Albuquerque street addresses (and later
businesses) to OSM. It is NOT really part of the City of Albuquerque's
open data initiative (http://cabq.gov/abq-data), but the data I use is
also available there now (it's been available for years, but was
harder to find).

Changeset 12068601 was my attempt to upload 45K addresses at a time;
this failed, as did my attempt to upload 5K addresses at a time, so
this changeset somehow ended up with 3839 nodes. I plan to update
bc-parse-addr.pl to ignore these nodes (alternate plan was to delete +
re-add, but that seems excessive)

Here's what I did with the output of bc-biz2ll.pl (ie,
data/businessaddresses.txt):

bzcat ../db/abqaddr.bz2|perl -pnle 's/\|/ /isg;' > /var/tmp/addr-with-space.txt
fgrep --color=always -if data/businessaddresses.txt /var/tmp/addr-with-space.txt > data/bizll.txt

This gives me latitude/longitude for ABQ businesses (roughly). Adding
coloring will let me snip out the exact address from the line.

note: test4.txt is the working version
